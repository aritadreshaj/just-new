Due to significant soil contamination from its industrial past, redevelopment was stalled until 2012, when a major developer initiated a market-driven approach. Their strategy, demolishing all existing structures to make way for generic new construction, is critically challenged by this counter-project. <p> In contrast, this alternative proposal advocates for the preservation and integration of the site’s ongoing renaturation. It recognizes open urban land as a vital and finite resource, prioritizing ecological balance over excessive land sealing. By concentrating development along a narrow perimeter and opting for vertical density, the design meets local needs while maintaining flexibility and resilience. <p> Sustainability is redefined in this context, not only through materials and energy but also by reconsidering spatial values and long-term urban health. The project’s evolution includes the development of a manifesto and a deeper theoretical foundation that critiques conventional, consumption-driven urbanism. <p> Inspired by O.M. Ungers’ concept of the Green Urban Archipelago, the design envisions a network of dense built zones interspersed with protected green “islands.” This model promotes ecological diversity and fosters a more conscious urban culture. Like a reef within a lagoon, the project serves as a resilient, living structure, preserving space while encouraging renewal."

Thus, by revitalizing Ms. & Mr. Ndrecaj’s abandoned property in Plave, Montenegro, the project pursues two main objectives: <p> 1. Reusing existing footprints.<p> 2.

Engaging local communities, employing sustainable materials, and fostering biodiversity conservation, our project prioritizes social responsibility. <p>Thus, at the peak of a new age of consumerism, this home is defined through its domestic paraphernalia—the furniture, fixtures, and accessories are the main characters of the space. The new social conditions are tied to the ownership and personal value attributed to space, ensuring an individualistic design. <p>Through this approach, Home&More encodes domestic spaces as social and cultural features through which we represent our nature—and live with it."

The original café located atop the former parking structure, an important social hub for the local community, has been preserved in its original position, maintaining its historical and cultural significance. <p> Comprising both a Public and an Academic Library, the building is elevated on a platform and framed by a porous architectural envelope that unifies the two volumes. These gaps form a shaded corridor that opens toward a green horizon, encouraging visual and physical continuity with the natural surroundings. Upon entry, visitors pass through a front garden lined with large trees and follow a gentle slope leading into the site. <p> To enable free flow of people and views, the design incorporates a structure of irregularly placed concrete cubes, creating the impression that the sloped ground and garden scenery extend into the interior. The intersections of these cubes introduce fluid circulation and spatial flexibility. Glass façades along the library promote transparency and engagement, fostering interaction between different parts of the building and reinforcing its role as a social and educational hub."

The design introduces bold, modern duplex apartments that offer diverse living experiences through expressive spatial organization, rhythm, and materiality. Serving as a visual mediator between two contrasting urban environments, the building captures the energy of the city across its dual facades. The new design replaces monotony with movement, obliquely arranged balconies in low-impact cementitious material animate the elevation, their textured surfaces softened by warm tones. A geometric play of black metal profiles disrupts the sleek glass, creating a bold, sustainable, and visually dynamic composition."

Each apartment is closely connected to the exterior, with balconies and openings designed to frame views, enhance privacy, and bring natural light deep into the living spaces. The duplex units extend this relationship vertically, with double-height sections that animate the façade and emphasize movement. In contrast, the flat units maintain a more grounded and uniform expression. This architectural rhythm responds to the dual context, bridging the energy of the city center with the calm of the campus side, allowing the building to serve as both a comfortable living environment and a bold urban statemen." }
